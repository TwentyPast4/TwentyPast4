- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TwentyPast4
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kinds of software engineering, pushing technology ever further - most of all game development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UE4/5, V8, and mastering the holy grail that is the full stack. Developing complex multi-threaded services with very low fault tolerance and integrating them with a beautiful frontend. I mostly work in C++.
- ðŸ’” Iâ€™m definitely not in a position to collaborate, sorry! No time right now 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @DanToskan on Twitter
